Question 2
Investigate the Spreadsheet and identify the flag.

Hint: Flag is in a cell hidden within the sheet.


1. I opened the given folder, and made a quick search if there were any data that can be found within the excel. Which didn't work.

2. I extracted the contents of the file with 7zip, and went into the "xl" folder.

3. Using powershell, I "cat" the sharedStrings.xml and the flag was found

Explanation from what I understand: The sharedStrings.xml file contains values that are found at in a cell within the excel document. SO it can be seen as a history of sorts. 

Interesting to note is that the strings that are recorded are saved in chronological order. So you can trace the order in which data was entered.
