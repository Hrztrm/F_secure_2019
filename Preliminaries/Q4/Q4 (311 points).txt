Identify the flag from the image. Key can be found in the file to unlock the flag.

1. A picture was given, passed it through exiftool just to be safe. Nothing unsual there.

2. Passed it through hex edit, found an interesting line that says "used stego technique to hide my super password :D" and "did you try 'fsecure' as a password?". So the flag is hidden using stego techniques, steghide time.

3. When using the info command on the file, there are embedded data hidden within it.

4. Used the extract -sf option to get the data, it asked for a passphrase. I used the given 'fsecure' which worked.

5. Flag was received in a flag.txt file.

Flag: fsmeta+stegcyber
